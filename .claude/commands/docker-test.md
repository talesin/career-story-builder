Run the Docker build and test workflow:

1. Execute scripts/docker-build.sh (or .ps1 on Windows)
2. Execute scripts/docker-test.sh to run tests in container
3. Report any failures with analysis
4. Suggest fixes for any issues found

If build fails, analyze the error and provide a fix before retrying.
